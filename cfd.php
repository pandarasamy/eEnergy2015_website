<h2 class="hcls">Call for Posters and Demos</h2>


<p>
The SIGCOMM poster/demo sessions showcase works-in-progress. The setting is informal. Topics of interest are the same as research topics in the SIGCOMM conference call for papers. 
</p>

<p>
Anyone can submit a poster/demo, but preference will be given to posters/demos where the primary contribution is from one or more students. The SIGCOMM 2012 Poster and Demo committee will review all posters and demo proposals. At the conference, students must present student posters. Authors of accepted papers in SIGCOMM 2012 may not submit a poster on the same work in those papers.
</p>

<h2 class="hcls">Student Research Competition</h2>

<p>
The SIGCOMM poster session will also serve as an ACM student research competition. Qualified entrants must have current ACM student membership, have graduate or undergraduate student status at the time of submission (May 2012), and be submitted by a single student author. Supervisors are not permitted to co-author the poster (contact the poster co-chairs if this represents a hardship).
</p>

<p>
Undergraduates and graduate students will be treated in separate divisions (students starting their first year of graduate school at the time of the conference will be considered as undergraduates). A small travel supplement is made available to accepted entrants; please also submit applications for travel grant support. The ACM SRC program is sponsored by Microsoft Research.  Winners will advance to ACM Grand Finals of the Student Research Competition to compete against the winners of other ACM conferences.
</p>

<p> ACM SIGCOMM thanks the following supporters of the Student Research Competition:</p>

<h2 class="hcls">Why Should You Submit a Poster?</h2>

<p>
This is a great chance especially for students to obtain interesting and valuable feedback on ongoing research from a knowledgeable crowd at the conference. In addition, the top few submissions will be forwarded for publication to the SIGCOMM newsletter, the Computer Communication Review (CCR). Students who are submitting posters are highly encouraged to examine if they are eligible for student travel grants.
</p>


<h2 class="hcls">What is a Poster?</h2>

<p>
We define a poster to be A0 paper size in portrait mode (841x1189mm), to which you can affix visually appealing material that describes your research. Alternatively, you can use the space as a continuum. You should prepare the best material (appealing and succinct) that effectively communicates your research problem, techniques, results, and what is novel and important about your work. Note that you do not submit such a large-format image; only an abstract describing in text what the poster would present.
</p>


<h2 class="hcls">Content</h2>

<p>
The abstract should clearly state: the problem being addressed; what makes this problem interesting, important, and difficult; your approach to the problem; and the key contribution. In the final version of the abstract, you should include a URL that provides additional information about your work to the attendees. 
</p>

<p>
Prepare your abstract using ACM conference style, modified to 10pt. Concretely, two columns, minimum 10pt times with 0.75 inch margins and 1/3 inch space between columns.  The abstract must be within the page limit and in PDF format. For submission, please use the following <a href="http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2012/sig-alternate-10pt.cls">LaTeX template</a> to ensure compliance. Word documents will not be accepted. At the conference, we will distribute the abstracts to all conference attendees.
</p>


<h2 class="hcls">What and Where to Submit</h2>

<p>
Please submit two-page abstracts for posters and demos via the <a href="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/sigcomm2012/" >submission system</a> following the format guidelines listed above. Submissions are single blind, so please include the authors' names and affiliation.
