The rapid development of Information-Centric Networking (ICN) concepts
in the last few years is one of the significant results from multiple
international Future Internet research activities. Based on the ICN
concepts, the principal communication paradigm is no longer end-to-end
data delivery between hosts as in the current Internet
architecture. Instead, ICN-based network architectures focus directly
on retrieving information objects securely, reliably, scalably, and
efficiently.  These architectural design efforts aim to directly
address the network challenges that arise from the increasing demand
for highly scalable content distribution, from accelerated growths of
mobile devices, and from wide deployment of Internet-of-things (IoT).

The resulting network architectures are expected to leverage
in-network storage, multiparty communication through replication and
interaction models to provide effective and efficient data
distribution in the communication services, and to provide effective
solutions in securing the network infrastructure as well as user data.

Important research topics for ICN include: naming and addressing (how
to name information objects, how to represent location information),
routing and resolution (deciding on how to forward "interest" in
information and actual information objects, whether and how to resolve
information object names to lower layer identifiers during that
process), resource management (implications of in-network caching and
paradigms such as receiver-orientation to resource sharing, congestion
control etc.) and security (privacy, data protection and key
distribution have to be adapted to the new communication models).


This workshop invites original contributions on Information-Centric
Networking architecture topics, specific algorithms and protocols, as
well as on results from implementations and experimentation.


                       ICN-2012 topics of Interest

                         Submission instructions
                         ------------------------

All submissions must be original work that has not been submitted to
any other workshop, conference, or journal. The workshop will accept
papers describing completed work as well as work-in-progress and
ongoing experiments. Papers describing practical experiments are
especially invited.  Submissions must be no greater than 6 pages in
length and must be in PDF format. Reviews will be single-blind: please
include authors name and affiliation in the submission.
