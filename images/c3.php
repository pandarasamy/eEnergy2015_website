The so-called smart grid is the classic example of a large scale infrastructure network supporting modern society. It is large scale in terms of the total number of devices connected as well as its geographic area coverage. It is complex because of the time and spatial scales it encompasses. 

The significant reduction in the cost of sensors and communication devices create new opportunities to manage the grid at time and spatial scales hitherto not considered feasible. Most pronounced are the opportunities in the last mile of the network. 

In a classic grid, where the sources are large, distinct and sparsely distributed point sources, the consumer behaviour in the last mile is typically a mere disturbance that is readily spatially averaged and hence relatively easy to manage. The introduction of large scale distributed generation based on solar, or so-called renewable energy sources, poses new challenges as these entail a significant departure of the classic grid paradigm. This trend, combined with the emerging opportunity to electrify personal transport, serves to motivate the consideration of the "smart grid" as a form of an intelligent, interconnected infrastructure, or an internet-of-things. Technically enabling this smart grid is in the realm of "communication, computation and control." At present there is a feverish level of activity in many diverse research communities, ranging from resource econometrics, classical power engineering to signal processing and computer science as well as communications engineering. Each community considers different approaches arriving at a version of a smart grid from very different perspectives. Clearly not one of these research communities "owns" the smart grid problem as such. It is our contention that a conflux of different expertise encompassing the societal, regulatory, economic and technical aspects is required to present feasible solutions that will transform over time the present grid into the nirvana of the smart grid. 

This workshop in conjunction with the ACM e-Energy conference aims to bring representatives from the communication, control and computation communities together to discuss collaborative progress towards smart grid solutions, and to elucidate limitations and opportunities of emerging smart grid proposals.
